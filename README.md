# 📡 Networking Projects Repository

Welcome to my **Networking Projects** repository! This space contains practical labs, exercises, and real-world configurations I’ve worked on while studying computer networks, VoIP, Cisco systems, and more.

## 🧠 About Me

I'm a student at the University of Isfahan, specializing in **Telecommunications and Networking**. This repository reflects my learning journey, hands-on practice, and simulations related to:
- IP addressing and subnetting
- VLANs and trunking
- Cisco routing and switching
- VoIP (Voice over IP)
- GSM networks
- Protocols (SIP, RTP, TCP/IP, etc.)

---

## 📂 Projects Breakdown

### 1. 🧮 IP Addressing & Subnetting
Practical exercises on:
- Subnet calculation
- CIDR notation
- IPv4 network design
- Valid/Invalid IP ranges

### 2. 🔁 Routing & Switching (Cisco Labs)
Simulated with Cisco Packet Tracer:
- Static & Dynamic Routing (RIP, EIGRP, OSPF)
- VLAN creation & inter-VLAN routing
- Router-on-a-stick setup
- Troubleshooting

### 3. 📞 VoIP & SIP Configuration
Projects focused on:
- Setting up VoIP systems
- SIP signaling
- RTP stream understanding
- Comparisons of SIP vs H.323

### 4. 🌐 GSM & Mobile Networks (Introductory Labs)
- GSM architecture basics
- Channel types & frequency bands
- Simulation of GSM network flow
- Mobile-to-mobile call flow

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Wireshark
- GNS3 (optional)
- Linux CLI (for networking tools)
- Asterisk (for VoIP practice)

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Solidify core networking concepts
- Simulate real-world network setups
- Prepare for certifications (e.g., **CCNA**, **VoIP**, etc.)
- Build a portfolio of useful configurations
